A Crop Prediction Model- predicting the type of crop most suitable for that region based on a number of environmental and climatic factors. 

CROP PREDICTION PROCEDURE

1.Algorithm (The model used for prediction is Random Forest). It was found to be the most accurate. 

2.Random Forest algorithm â€“

Step-1: Select random K data points from the training set.

Step-2: Build the decision trees associated with the selected data points (Subsets).

Step-3: Choose the number N for decision trees that you want to build.

Step-4: Repeat Step 1 & 2.

Step-5: For new data points, find the predictions of each decision tree, and assign the new data points to the category that wins the majority votes.
